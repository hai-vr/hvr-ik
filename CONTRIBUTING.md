*The following is written by Haï~ and covers the project hvr-ik located at https://github.com/hai-vr/hvr-ik and pull requests opened specifically
at https://github.com/hai-vr/hvr-ik ; the contents of this CONTRIBUTING.md does not apply to any fork of the project that receives contributions.* 

If you want to contribute to this project, please be advised of the following:

This project (hvr-ik) is currently under the [Apache License 2.0 (https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html)](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html),
but I want to keep the possibility of switching the license to the [MIT License (https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html)](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html)
in the future if I chose to do so.

When you would like to share a contribution in a pull request, you will be asked to confirm that you accept for your contribution
to be relicensed to the MIT License if the project license ever choses to switch to the MIT License.

This does imply that you confirm you have full ownership of the changes that you are submitting to the https://github.com/hai-vr/hvr-ik project.
If you do not have full ownership (example: a portion of the contribution also comes from another MIT Licensed project), then you should disclose
it in your pull request and it will be managed on a case-by-case basis.

To clear any ambiguity: this only covers switching from the Apache License 2.0 to **the MIT License, specifically**; and not any other license.
This is **not** a transfer of ownership rights over your work. I (Haï~) do not have the right to relicense your contribution to any other license
than the MIT License.

*MIT License* refers to this specific MIT License as defined in SPDX, and not any other variant: https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html
