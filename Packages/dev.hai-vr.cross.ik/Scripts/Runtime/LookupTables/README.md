# LookupTables

## What is this?

This is a file generated by the project located in `Tooling/Training/Training.csproj` and contains a pre-baked 21x21x21 lookup table,
which is used by one of the two heuristics to control the arm bend direction.

We're using a lookup table to avoid putting a prediction engine inside the solver.

This file is read by HIKFullTiger.cs in the `ParseLookup` function, and the data of this file is consumed by HIKBendLookup.cs in
the `ImportLookupTable` function.
